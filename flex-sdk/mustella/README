Install Prerequisites
=====================

	Mustella requires some variables set: AIR_HOME, FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER, PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME, and ANT_HOME. Use absolute file paths
	when setting these values as relative path names can cause compilation errors.

	There are several places you can set these values (in order of preference):

	* from ../env.properties in the main Flex source directory. See ../env-template.properties for details.
	* from shell environment variables.
	* from ./local.properties in the Mustella main directory. See ./local-template.properties. This file can set or override 
	the environment variables as well as setting Mustella-specific values. 


Trust Files
===========

	Before running any tests, be sure to set up the Flash Player trust configuration. Create or edit a file called
	dev.trust.cfg and add a line for the full path to the Mustella tests directory according to your platform. This will make the Flash
	Player trust all SWFs in that directory structure.

	Mac OS X location: /Library/Application Support/Macromedia/FlashPlayerTrust

		example: /Users/YourUser/apache/flex/mustella/tests

	Windows XP location: C:\Documents and Settings\YourUser\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player\#Security\FlashPlayerTrust

		example: c:\apache\flex\mustella\tests
	
	Windows 7 location: C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\Macromedia\Flash Player\#Security\FlashPlayerTrust

		example: c:\cygwin\home\YourAccount\apache\flex\mustella\tests

Basic Commands
==============

	Run Mustella tests from the mustella directory using the mini_run.sh script. Windows users must use a 
	Unix-compatible shell application. The mini_run.sh script produces console output, results.txt (for the list of tests that
	pass), and failures.txt (for the list of tests that fail); but passes and failures are also reported on the console log.

		./mini_run.sh -all

	This command will run all of the tests.

		./mini_run.sh -failures

	This command will run all of the tests reported in failures.txt; tests that fail will 'timed out' will not be re-run, however.

		./mini_run.sh tests/components/Label

	This command will run just the tests in the components/Label test directory.

		./mini_run.sh -caseName=datagrid_properties_columns_0 tests/components/DataGrid/DataGrid_SparkSkin/Properties/datagrid_properties_columns.mxml

	This command runs a specific test case from a specific test file.
