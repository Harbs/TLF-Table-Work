<!-- FXG 1.0 Test BitmapFill fills a shape with repeating bitmap image (tiling)                   -->
<!-- The BitmapFill element fills a path or shape with an optionally repeating bitmap image.

By default, the bitmap image is used to paint a fill rectangle stretching from (0,0) at the top left to the (width,height) of the bitmap image, in the coordinate space of the shape's parent grouping element's coordinate system, transformed by any matrix transformation defined on the Fill.
