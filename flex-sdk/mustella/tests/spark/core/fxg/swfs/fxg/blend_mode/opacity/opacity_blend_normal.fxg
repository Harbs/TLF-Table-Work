<!-- FXG 1.0 Tests of Blend mode = normal, alpha (opacity) = 0, 1, 0.5                              -->
<!-- Grouping elements are rendered in one of two different ways, depending on their blend mode. A grouping element with a blend mode of 'normal' acts only as a transformation on the elements contained within. Its 2D transform, color transform, and opacity are multiplied down into its child elements, where they are combined with any local values to render the child element into the current surface.    
All other blend modes force the group to act as a temporary compositing surface onto which its child elements are rendered. The surface is initialized to transparent black, and the child elements are composited in. The temporary surface is then composited into the grouping element's parent's surface, applying the grouping element's opacity, color transform, and 2D transform in the process.                                                                              -->
