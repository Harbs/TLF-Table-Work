<!-- Warning: FXG Viewer doesn't render this file correctly (looks like matrix element is ignored), but Illustrator CS4 does.                                                                                		-->
<!-- FXG 1.0 Test Linear Gradient fills a path using child matrix element not discreet transform attributes                    -->
<!-- The LinearGradient element fills a path or shape with a continuously smooth color transition between a list of colors along a vector. 

The gradient vector is the vector stretching from (0,-0.5) to (0,0.5), in the coordinate space of the shape's parent grouping element's coordinate system, transformed by any matrix transformation defined on the LinearGradient.

The gradient vector can be modified using either discreet transform attributes on the LinearGradient element, or by providing an explicit 2D matrix transform as a child element.

It is illegal to define both discreet transform attributes and child matrix element on the same LinearGradient.
