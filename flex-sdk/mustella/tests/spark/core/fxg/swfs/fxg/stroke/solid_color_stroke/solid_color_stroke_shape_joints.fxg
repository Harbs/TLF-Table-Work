<!-- FXG 1.0 Test Stroke a shape with solid color with joints.                   -->
<!-- FXG strokes support three ways of rendering the joints between path segments, specified with the joints attribute. Legal values are:

bevel: The joint is capped by the line running through the joint perpendicular to the line bisecting the joint angle. 
miter: The joint is rendered by slicing the stroke of the two joining segments with the outer edge of the opposite segment's stroke. 
round: The joint is rendered with a circle whose diameter matches the weight of the stroke centered on the joint. 
FXG strokes also support the miterLimit attribute. This is a numeric value that imposes a limit on the ratio between the stroke weight and the miter length. When the limit is exceeded, the join is converted from a miter to a bevel. Valid values range from 0 to 255.
