<!-- FXG 1.0 Test Stroke a path with solid color with scaleMode.                   -->
<!-- A stroke is extrapolated from a path or shape after the points have been converted into document coordinate space.  Generally, the local transform of the shape isn't applied to the stroke. However, during painting, the weight of the paint applied to the transformed shape is adjusted to match the scale factor in the shape's transform matrix. How the scale factor affects the weight of the stroke is controlled by the stroke's scale mode. Strokes support the following scale modes:

normal: Scale the stroke outline using the scale component of the current coordinate transformation. 
none: No scale is applied to the stroke weight. 
vertical: The weight of the stroke is scaled by the vertical scale component of the transform applied to the shape. The horizontal scale component has no effect on the stroke weight. 
horizontal: The weight of the stroke is scaled by the horizontal scale component of the transform applied to the shape. The vertical scale component has no effect on the stroke weight.
