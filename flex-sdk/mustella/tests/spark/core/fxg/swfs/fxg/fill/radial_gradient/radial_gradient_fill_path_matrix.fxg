<!-- FXG 1.0 Test Radial Gradient fills a path using child matrix element not discreet transform attributes                     -->
<!-- The RadialGradient element fills a path or shape with a continuously smooth color transition between a list of colors along the radius of a circle.

The circle used is the circle bounded by the box stretching from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5,0.5). Like LinearGradient, it is transformed by the matrix transform defined on the gradient.

RadialGradient supports all the same transform attributes and child elements that LinearGradient does. Additionally, because its rendering is defined by a box and not just a horizontal vector, it supports a scaleY attribute that is used along with scaleX to scale the bounding box before the other transform attributes are applied.

RadialGradient elements also define the attribute focalPointRatio. This defines where along the horizontal axis (of the untransformed box) the focal point of the radial gradient lies. A value of 1 places it at the right hand edge of the box (at 0.5,0). A value of -1 places it at the left hand edge of the box (at -0.5,0).

RadialGradient elements use child GradientEntry elements the same way LinearGradient elements do.
