    <!--
    Infrastructure to support the On-Demand Scrollbars mini feature:
    
        "This feature updates the Scroller skinning contract so that ScrollBars can be 
        specified as factory parts in order to allow deferred-creation. Additionally, 
        it implements the defferred-creation optimization for the interactionMode="touch"
        case. The new skinning contract should allow us to implement the optimization for 
        interactionMode="mouse" at a later time without additional public API changes."
    
    This view has different states that enable 0, 1, or both scrollbars and the Mustella
    test should check that TrackScrollBarCreationSkin.numVScrollBarsCreated/numHScrollBarsCreated
    contains the correct values.
