========================================================
Test maximizable = true
- Note that maximizable can only be set in the AIR XML
file, so here we can only test true.  False is handled
in another file.
- This tests the maximizable property.
- These are not tests specifically for the maximize
button or the maximize() method; those are tested
elsewhere.
- We cannot compare the height of the app. with the
height of the screen due to the Mac's toolbar, Windows'
task bar, stuff like that.  So we just use the width,
which should be consistent, and the nativeWindow's
displayState property.
- These are order dependent!  The last tests are on
a closed window, so tests on an open window cannot
be put after them.

ALL TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON A CLOSED WINDOW.  IT CANNOT BE REOPENED.
