<!-- 
    There is a different SWF file for each HTML wrapper.
    The wrappers have different values for their flashvars.
    Verification is done by:
        localeChain: By the time preinitialize has occurred, the locale chain should be
            in application.parameters.  So get it and put it in a variable.  When Mustella
            runs, check that variable.  Make sure the ResourceManager's localeChain
            matches.  Also, have one sanity check that makes sure a label really ends
            up using a resource from a loaded SWF and uses the correct entry from the
            localeChain.
        resourceModuleURLs: Verify that the parameter gets set the same way as with
            localeChain.  Also, use the ResourceModule API to verify that the resources
            from the loaded SWFs are available.  Also, have one sanity check that makes 
            sure a label really ends up using a resource from a loaded SWF and uses the
            correct entry from the localeChain.
