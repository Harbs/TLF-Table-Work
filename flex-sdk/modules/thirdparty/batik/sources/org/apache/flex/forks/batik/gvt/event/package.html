    <title>GVT Event Package</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with different types
    of events fired by GVT graphics nodes. Events are fired by event
    sources. An event listener registers with an event source to
    receive notifications about the events of a particular type. This
    package defines events and event listeners, as well as event
    listener adapters, which are convenience classes to make easier
    the process of writing event listeners.
