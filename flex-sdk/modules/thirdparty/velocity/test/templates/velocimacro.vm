@test velocimacro.vm

This template is used for Velocity regression testing.
If you alter this template make sure you change the
corresponding comparison file so that the regression 
test doesn't fail incorrectly.

## inline VM : shows how a tablerow might be generated

#macro( tablerow  $array $color )
#foreach( $element in $array )
   <tr><tdi bgcolor=$color>$element</td></tr>
#end
#end

Now, use the \#quietnull example from the global library VM_global_library.vm : 
Now, there should be nothing in the brackets : >#quietnull($nada)<

#set($foo = "hello!")
Where there should be something here : >#quietnull($foo)<

#set($arr = ["$10.24","$15.32","$12.15"])
#set($col = "blue")

<table>
#tablerow( $arr $col)
</table>


Further tests.  The following VMs and non-VM should be properly escaped :
\#tablerow
\#quietnull
\#notavm
>\\#quietnull($nada)<

Now try to define a new quietnull VM :
#macro( quietnull $a )
	QuietNull : $a
#end

It should have been rejected, as the default is to not let inlines override existing, and there
should be a message in velocity.log.
Therefore it should still function normally :
>#quietnull($foo)<
>#quietnull($nada)<

We should be able to use argless VMs (and directives....)
#macro( noargs )
Hello! I have no args!
#end

#noargs()


And there was a bug where I wasn't getting the params right for the use-instance :

#macro( showarg $i )
Arg :>$i<
#end

#showarg( $jdom.getRootElement().getChild("properties").getChild("author").getTextTrim() )

String literals should work as you expect :
#showarg( "stringliteral")


Test boolean args :

#testbool(true)
#testbool(false)
