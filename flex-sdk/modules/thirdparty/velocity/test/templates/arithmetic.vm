@test arithmetic.vm

This template is used for Velocity regression testing.
If you alter this template make sure you change the
corresponding comparison file so that the regression 
test doesn't fail incorrectly.

*#

#set($foo = 5)
#set($foo = $foo + 1)
$foo

#set($foo = $foo - 1)
$foo

#set($foo = $foo * 2)
$foo

#set($foo = $foo / 2)
$foo

And the whole thing again with inline set statements

#set( $foo = 5)
#set( $foo = $foo + 1)
$foo

#set ( $foo = $foo - 1 )
$foo

#set( $foo = $foo * 2)
$foo

#set ($foo = $foo / 2)
$foo
