@test pedantic.vm

This template is used for Velocity regression testing.
If you alter this template make sure you change the
corresponding comparison file so that the regression
test doesn't fail incorrectly.

*#
#set( $pedantic = "pedantic")

This is a test of the new #if($pedantic)$pedantic#end mode.

There are a few things you can do in #if($foobar) GOOGLE! #else$pedantic#end mode.

Like get the spacing between things #foreach($a in $stringarray)$a#end to be really, really tight.

Further, it now binds any \n to the control structures, taking them out of the output.
The hope that this is What You Expect. 
So...

--
#if ($pedantic)
$pedantic
#end
--

should come out looking like

--
pedantic
--

But pay attention to what follows the \#end statement :

1) First, follow with 'stuff' (not sure why you want to do this... but anway...)

--
#if ($pedantic)
$pedantic
#end woogie!
--

should be

--
pedantic
 woogie!
--

2) Whitespace will be eaten if there is a following newline 

--
#if ($pedantic)
$pedantic
#end  		  
--

should be

--
pedantic
--


-- INLINE STUFF ---

1) respect spaces in the block
>#foreach($a in $stringarray)$a#end<
>#foreach($a in $stringarray) $a#end<
>#foreach($a in $stringarray)$a #end<
>#foreach($a in $stringarray) $a #end<

2) set statement has no output, incuding preceeding whitespace
#foreach($a in $stringarray)
		#set($b = $a)
 $a is $b
#end

	public void foo( String lala )
	{
#foreach($a in $stringarray)
		#set($b = $a)
  		System.out.println("$b"); 
#end
	}

	public void foo( String lala )
	{
	#foreach($a in $stringarray)
		#set($b = $a)
  	System.out.println("$b"); 
	#end
	}

Inline set statement :

Here are the prices :#set( $arr = ["$10.24","$15.32","$12.15"] ) #foreach($a in $arr) $a #end
