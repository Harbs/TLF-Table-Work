## This is to test a properties file that was once taken from
## the file system but is now taken from a JAR. We have to
## deprecate the use of $generator.TemplatePath if we want
## templates to work the same way from JARs and the file
## system. I have a hack in PropsUtil right now to deal
## with it.
