It is a lonesome, and, when the character is inclined to thought, may be an intensely thoughtful occupation; as it proved in the case of Ethan Brand, who had mused to such strange purpose, in days gone by, while the fire in this very kiln was burning.</span></p><p textAlign="justify" textAlignLast="start"><span>The man who now watched the fire was of a different order, and troubled himself with no thoughts save the very few that were requisite to his business. </span></p><p textAlign="justify" textAlignLast="center"><span>At frequent intervals, he flung back the clashing weight of the iron door, and, turning his face from the insufferable glare, thrust in huge logs of oak, or stirred the immense brands with a long pole. </span></p><p textAlign="justify" textAlignLast="end"><span>Within the furnace were seen the curling and riotous flames, and the burning marble, almost molten with the intensity of heat; while without, the reflection of the fire quivered on the dark intricacy of the surrounding forest, and showed in the foreground a bend and ruddy little picture of the hut, the spring beside its door, the athletic and coal-begrimed figure of the lime-burner, and the half-fendened child, shrinking into the protection of his father's shadow. </span></p><p textAlign="justify" textAlignLast="justify"><span>And when again the iron door was closed, then reappeared the tender light of the half-full moon, which vainly strove to trace out the indistinct shapes of the neighboring mountains; and, in the upper sky, there was a flitting congregation of clouds, still faintly tinged with the rosy sunset, though thus far down into the valley the sunshine had vanished long and long ago.</span></p></TextFlow>
